I am Lena from Hamburg, Germany and I am a computer science student at the University of Applied Sciences.
In addition to studying for my Master's degree I work as a research student at the Internet Technologies Research Group at HAW, where I help develop the open source IoT operating system RIOT.
This site is my CV, portfolio and blog, in which I draw and write about what I do.

Come find me on Github.
